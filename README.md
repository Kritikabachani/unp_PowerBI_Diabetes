# UNP-Project_BI-with-Power-BI_Diabetes

Completed this project as part of my Power BI internship with United Network Of Professionals(UNP).

KEY HIGHLIGHTS :
Contibuted in developing the main factors for the topic, its insights as well as the overall dashboard arrangement. Involved in significantly enhancing data visualization and data-friendliness.

Step 1 - Data Transformation: Employed DAX to compute Age groups and BMI Ranges. Eliminated null values to ensure data accuracy for analysis purposes.
Step 2 - Creating the Dashboard: Utilised a pie chart to show the average insulin by age. Average skin thickness by BMI range, average blood pressure by age, and average glucose by age are displayed using a bar chart. Used the  area chart to show the average blood pressure and glucose levels by pregnancy. Used cards to display vital metrics such as average insulin and glucose.
Step 3 - Created an insightful end report emphasizing the key parameters.
